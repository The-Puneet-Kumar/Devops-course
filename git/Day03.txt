Git & GitHub - Day 03
=========================
GitHub?
	GitHub is the place where we store the source code of the application - Developers point of view.

	As a DevOps engineer, we will store Jenkinsfile, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, Kubernetes manifest files, Terraform files, Ansible yml files...

GitHub is a cloud based server which is maintained by the GitHub organization
GitHub Certifications;

GitHub consists of repositories (folders)

Types of repositories based on visibility;
	1. Public Repo	- anything that we store here will be visible and accessible to the public
	2. Private Repo	- anything that we store here will be visible and accessible to the specific people

A GitHub profile can be created to attract the recruiters

Creating a GitHub account;
https://github.com/

For every repo, we will get a repo URL
Repo URL will be in two forms;
	1. HTTPS
	2. SSH

Pushing the code to remote repo;

To configure the credentials, we will create PAT (Personal Access Token)


Pulling the code from remote to local;
git clone <RepoURL>

Note: Whenever we clone any remote repo, we dont have to initialize git, because by default git will get initialized.

GIT BRANCHES
Git branches are used to isolate the code from different features of the application.
In real-time, we will have separate branch for each feature of the application (OR) we might have a separate repo for each feature of the application

We will have two branches by default;
	1. master (git terminal)
	2. main (GitHub repo)


Note: When we initialize git in the local, we will have "master" as the default branch

git branch

Note: When we switch from existing branch to a newly created branch, whatever files that are available in the existing branch, all those files will get copied to the newly created branch (including the content)

GIT IGNORE
Here we will tell to git to ignore files which are mentioned in a special file known as ".gitignore"
Whatever files that are mentioned in the .gitignore file, those files will not be available in the remote repo even if they are pushed to remote repo
