Git & GitHub - Day 04
=========================

to delete the branch remotely
git push origin --delete train (Remote deletion)

git branch -D train (Local deletion)

To recover the deleted branch, when its deleted from the remote as well;
git reflog
git checkout -b train ebe9e24

Note: ebe9e24 is the commit id where the branch and files are available

Task: Recover the deleted branch from remote, when its deleted using git bash terminal

Recovering the deleted branch remotely;

Pull Request;
	i) Remote
		I want to merge the files from one branch (dth) to another branch (master)

Master branch --- master.txt --- no content
dth branch --- master.txt --- content is available

GIT PULL
To get the changes, which were made in the remote, from remote repo to local repo

Note: without pulling the changes available in remote repo, we cannot push the changes to remote repo

PULL Vs CLONE
Clone will get the complete code from remote to local
Pull will get only the changes available in remote

FORKING A REPO
Project -----> Clone ----> Push to your account
Without cloning we can get the complete code from one repo to another repo

GIT REBASE
git rebase train
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/movies.


🔹 Git Merge
Combines changes from one branch into another using a merge commit
Maintains the branch history as it happened (non-linear history)
Good for preserving context, especially in shared/team branches
Easier and safer because it does not rewrite commit history'

🔹 Git Rebase
Moves or “rebases” commits on top of another branch
Linear and cleaner history
Rewrites commit hashes → not safe for branches already shared with others

MERGE CONFLICTS
Dev1 --- branch 1 --- code.txt --- Java code
Dev2 --- branch 2 --- code.txt --- Python code


Master Branch --- code.txt --- Hello World
Dev1 --- branch 1 --- code.txt --- Java code
Dev2 --- branch 2 --- code.txt --- Python code

After merging;
Master Branch --- code.txt --- Java code (Hello World is overwritten)
Branch 1 --- code.txt --- java code
Branch 2 --- code.txt ---
