File Creation

We can create files in 5 ways;
1. touch
2. vi
3. cat
4. nano
5. echo

1. touch - it is used to create an empty file
touch <FileName>

kastro1.java
kastro2.java 
kastro3.java
.
.
.
kastro10.java

touch kastro{16..20}.net
rm <FileName>

To delete specific files with extension
rm *.java

To delete specific files with common name
rm linux*

To delete all the files in the current location
rm -rf *

How to identify whether it is a file or a directory
If the starting character is "d" then it is a directory
If the starting character is "-" then it is a file

2. Using CAT command
2.1. Write the data inside an existing file
cat > kastro1.txt

To come out of the file ---> control + c

2.2. To see/verify the data inside a file
cat kastro1.txt

2.3. If we use "cat > kastro1.txt", if there is any data available that data will get overwritten i.e old data will be replaced with newly written data

2.4. I want to preserve (append) the old data and also i want to write new data in the file
cat >> kastro1.txt

2.5. Create and write the data inside a file
cat > linux.py
Note: If "linux.py" file is not available, first the file gets created and then we can write the data

3. Using VI/VIM command
vi/vim is a Linux editor
vi <FileName>
Go to insert mode (press "i")
Write the data
Come out of the insert mode (press "esc")
To save and come out of the file (:wq) ----> Hit "enter" button

Note: if we use :q!, you will quit from the file without saving the data

3.2. Creating and writing the data inside a file
vi <FileName>

4. Using "ECHO" to create a file
echo "This is my file" > sanket.py

5. Using "NANO" 
nano yash.java
Write the data
Control + X
Press Y (to save)
Enter

To see the data inside a file in a random order
sort kastro1.txt (or) sort -r kastro1.txt

COMPARE command
To see the differences between any two files

FIND command
To search by file name
sudo find / -name kastro5.txt

To search by file location
sudo find /home/ec2-user/ -name raut3.txt

To print the line numbers and its data
cat -n kastro1.txt

To print the data in reverse order
tac kastro1.txt

COPY command
cp kastro1.txt kastro2.txt

cat kastro1.txt raut1.txt > kastro3.txt

cp kastro1.txt /home/ec2-user/kastro/

cp -r dir1/* dir2/

HEAD and TAIL commands
HEAD command will display the content from top
 head kastro1.txt ---> It will show you the first 10 lines in a file

head -n 5 kastro1.txt

TTAIL command will display the content from bottom

tail kastro1.txt ---> It will show you the last 10 lines in a file

tail -n 3 kastro1.txt

Task: Find out how to see from a specific line to another specific line
I want to see the data from line 3 to line 7 from top in a specific file
I want to see the data from line 3 to line 7 from bottom in a specific file

WORDCOUNT
wc linux.py
1 (number of lines)  6 (number of words) 29 (number of characters) linux.py

GREP
Global Regular Expression Print
It is used to search for a word in a file

grep 'deployment' kastro.txt
Note: The above command is case sensitive

To ignore case sensitivity
grep -i 'deployment' kastro.txt

To search for a word in all the files available
grep -i 'deployment'*

grep -i -n 'deployment' kastro.txt

SED Command
SED - Stream Editor
It is used to replace the text without opening the file

SUBSTITUTE
sed 's/deployment/deploy/' kastro.txt
Note: The above command will only replace the word in the frontend. But when we do "cat <filename>" you will see the original word only

Task: Find the command to replace the word permanently

DELETE
sed '$d' kastro.txt
Note: The above command will only delete the word in the frontend. But when we do "cat <filename>" you will see the original word only

Task: Find the command to delete the word permanently

Find the command to delete the lines permanently
from specific line to specific line (line 6 to line 10 from top, line 6 to line 10 from bottom)

To print the content from speicifc line to another specific line
sed -n '2,5p'  kastro.txt

FILE PERMISSIONS
CHMOD command

File permissions in Linux are categorized into 3 ways;
	1. User permissions 	- u
	2. Group permissions	- g
	3. Others permissions	- o

Each category is again divided into 3 permissions
read			- r
write		- w
execute		- x

rw-r--r--
Users category ----> read, write are available
Group category ----> only read permission is available
Others category ----> only read permission is available

Add ---> + 
Remove ---> -

chmod u+x kastro.txt
chmod g+w kastro.txt
chmod g+x kastro.txt
chmod o+x kastro.txt
chmod o+w kastro.txt
chmod o-r kastro.txt
chmod g-r kastro.txt
chmod u-r kastro.txt
chmod u-rw kastro.txt
chmod u+rw kastro.txt
